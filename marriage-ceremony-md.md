### (4) Charge to the bride and Groom
*(Ephesians 5:22-33)*

> **22** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
> 
> **23** For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
> 
> **24** Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
> 
> **25** Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
> 
> **26** That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
> 
> **27** That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
> 
> **28** So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
> 
> **29** For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
> 
> **30** For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
> 
> **31** For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
> 
> **32** This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
> 
> **33** Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

**TO GROOM:** UMARU EMMANUEL SHAIBU, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour?

**RESPONSE:** I have.

Have you received the baptism in the Holy Spirit?

**RESPONSE:** I have

**TO BRIDE:** WINNIE UFEDO HASSAN have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour?

**RESPONSE:** I have

Have you received the baptism in the Holy Spirit?

**RESPONSE:** I have

**TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM:** Now upon the public profession of your faith, you have made known to all men that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is Lord and Saviour.

A miracle took place when you made Jesus the Lord of your life. The Holy Spirit used the very power of God, His creative power, to cause your spirit to be reborn. It is the same power that God used when He raised Jesus from the dead, in regenerating your spirit.

When two born-again believers come before God to be joined together as husband and wife, the Apostle Paul calls it "a mystery".

I want you to understand that if you rightly discern the body of Christ, then you rightly discern the miracle that takes place in marriage. You will not just be one in the eyes of the law. Something much more powerful that happens. The very creative power of God joins you together.

Marriage is a blood covenant between a man and a woman with God as the first witness. This covenant is serious business and can only be successfully operated by knowledge, love and sacrifice.

Something holy, something beyond reproach is about to take place by the Spirit of God inside your bosom; and it is a precious thing. Don't ever tamper with this union.

**TO WITNESS:**

You are not here just because of tradition. You are here for a serious purpose – to bear witness forever of a miraculous union that is taking take place, and to add your agreement before God to that which is happening here.

Don't ever, ever, ever tamper with this agreement. From this day forward, regardless of what comes, you are in agreement with this union. Don't ever attempt in any way to cause it to be anything other than a happy union

**UNVEIL THE BRIDE**

### (5) Profession of vows

**TO GROOM:** UMARU EMMANUEL SHAIBU, do you take WINNIE UFEDO HASSAN as your wife, as your own flesh, to love her even as Christ loves the Church, to protect her and care for her for the rest of your lives?

**RESPONSE:** I do

Then turn to her and make this profession of your faith:

> I, UMARU EMMANUEL SHAIBU, according to the Word of God, leave my father and mother and join myself to you, to be a husband to you. From this moment forward, we shall be one, standing together against evil, sin, sickness and poverty as we both fulfill God's call for our lives.

**TO the BRIDE:** WINNIE UFEDO HASSAN do you take UMARU EMMANUEL SHAIBU, as your husband, submitting yourself to him as unto the Lord, showing reverence to him as the head of this union for the rest of your lives?

**RESPONSE:** I do.

Then turn to him and make this profession of your faith:

> I WINNIE UFEDO HASSAN, according to the Word of God, submit myself to you, to be a wife to you. From this moment forward, we shall be one, standing together against evil, sin, sickness and poverty as we both fulfill God's call for our lives.

### (6) Presentation of Rings

"May I have the rings please?"

A ring is a very precious thing – a token of your love. This ring is made out of precious metal because the marriage covenant is precious. It is a never-ending circle that indicates the continuing love of God – a love that never fails, never presents itself haughtily nor is puffed up.

I want you to wear these rings as a continual reminder of your faith, a continual reminder of the confession of faith you have made to each other and to God.

The Word of God says, "Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one." If anyone could break up this union, it would be Satan, so give him no place whatsoever! This union is forever more.

**TO GROOM:** Take this ring, place it on her finger and say this to her:

> "With this ring, I thee wed. It is a token of my love for you and a token of my faith that I release now, in Jesus name".

**TO BRIDE:** Take this ring, place it on his finger and say this to him:

> "With this ring, I thee wed. I give it as a token of my faith; I believe with all my heart that this is forever. It is my love and my faith, in the name of Jesus.

### (7) Pronouncement

**TO BRIDE AND GROOM:** Join right hands please.

As a representative of Jesus Christ, before the Almighty God, by the authority vested in me as an ordained minister of the Gospel and in the name of the Father, of His Son Jesus, and by the power of Holy Spirit of God, I now pronounce you one together. You are now husband and wife.

### (8) You May Kiss the Bride

**SPECIAL SONGS**

### (9) Communion

**To Bride and groom:** It is important that in these first moments together you honour the Lord and honour His table. Jesus said, "This is my body, broken for you, eat of it,"

**GIVE BREAD TO COUPLE**

His precious body bore your sicknesses and carried your diseases. The two of you together in the name of Jesus Christ have the God-given faith and the God-given power to ward off sickness, disease, the storms of life, and everything that hell would offer any marriage. Through this broken body, you have received into your hands the awesome power of Almighty God. You may eat.

**GIVE CUP TO COUPLE**

Jesus also said, "This is my blood that ratifies the covenant. Drink of blood and as often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me."

As you drink, I want you to remember what He has done for you. I want you to remember the covenant that he has made available to you – the power, the victory and grace that he has made yours. You may drink.

### (10) Blessing of the Union

Galatians chapter 3 says that "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,… so that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might be heirs of the promise of the Spirit".

First Peter chapter 3 says a man and his wife are heirs together of the grace of life.

I am going to release God's blessing on both of you individually and on this marriage. So please agree with me as I speak God's Word over your lives.
