            When people talk about love at first sight, I laugh, because this was definitely not that kind of story for me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            I met Omar at a time when I had zero interest in romance. I wasn&apos;t looking for anything serious. I had just finally gone on leave from work and needed a break from the same old routine. So I opened my Bumble app, swiped, and thought, &quot;Let me meet a stranger, gist over drinks, and then go back to my life. No strings, no stories.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            That stranger turned out to be Omar. We talked over the phone and agreed he could come pick me up in the evening for drinks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            He came to pick me up from my house. I got in the car, saw what he was wearing, this man looked like he was on his way to paint a house. No effort. No style. Justâ€¦chaos. I, on the other hand, wasn&apos;t dressed to impress, but I wore a simple, nice dress. One look at him and I went back inside, changed into jeans and a t-shirt, and told myself, &quot;Let me not waste this dress on this one.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            By the time I came back out my kid sister had finished interrogating him and we were off to the weirdest first date ever. We got to the place, and the gist began and it just flowed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            There was something about him; the way he listened, the way he laughed, the way it felt like I had known him for years. I&apos;d never felt so comfortable, so quickly. It didn&apos;t feel like a first date. It felt like catching up with someone who had always been in my life, there was no pressure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Still, I ran emotionally. I wasn&apos;t trying to fall for anyone, but Omar? He was and still is consistent, gentle, and Intentional. He just always said &quot;keep running o. I will still marry you&quot; and i always thought to myself and even told him &quot;can never be me!&quot;. Guess who the joke is on now and I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever hear the last of it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            He never gave up. And that&apos;s just who he is. Whether it&apos;s love, work, or faith, he stays. He tries. He believes. Until things work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            He&apos;s a man of bold faith, the kind that sometimes scares me with how real and grounded it is. He&apos;s incredibly humble, And stubborn? Whew. Like a goat. ðŸ˜‚ But that same stubbornness is what makes him unwavering. Loyal. Solid.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            I like him so much. I trust him. I admire him. I laugh with him. I cry with him. He&apos;s my friend. And somehow through one random swipe on a hopeless app, and a date that wasn&apos;t supposed to mean anything, I found the love of my life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-6">
            I&apos;m so grateful it&apos;s him. So happy I stopped running. So excited for everything ahead.
